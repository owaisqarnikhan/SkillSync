Project Overview
Develop a responsive, real-time, web-based Training Management System for the Bahrain Asian Youth Games 2025, enabling national teams to efficiently and securely book training venues. The system supports three user roles—SuperAdmin, Manager/Admin, and Customer/User—and ensures seamless, conflict-free reservations within defined rules. The interface is accessible across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Key Features & Enhancements

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

SuperAdmin: configure countries, teams, venues, users; define scheduling rules; set system-wide settings; oversee audit logs.

Manager: manage bookings for assigned venues or teams; approve/decline requests; view real-time request queues and booking heatmaps.

Customer/User: search for venues; request bookings (max 2 hours); manage their team's bookings; receive notifications and queue status updates.

Booking Rules & Conflict Avoidance

Enforce a two-hour maximum booking limit per session.

Use PostgreSQL exclusion constraints—or appropriate database-level locks—to prevent overlapping bookings.

Respect venue-specific working hours, blackout periods, and mandatory buffer times between sessions.

Support real-time queuing, with visible queue positions and estimated wait times.

Live Interface & Calendar View

Calendar Views: day/week/month with drag-and-drop slot creation; switch to compact 'list' or 'agenda' view on mobile.

Visual Indicators: lock slots when pending or booked; use distinct color codes per team, per status (requested, approved, denied, in-queue).

Real-Time Updates: broadcasting using Socket.IO (or equivalent) so new, updated, or canceled bookings reflect instantly across users' UIs.

Notifications System

Send email notifications for booking confirmations, updates, denials, cancellations, and upcoming session reminders (e.g. 10 minutes before end).

Support multiple providers such as SendGrid and AWS SES.

Implement job scheduling and queuing (e.g., via Redis + BullMQ or an equivalent) to manage notification dispatch reliably and at scale.

Security & Compliance

Use JWT for authentication and strong RBAC for authorization.

Hash passwords securely (bcrypt or similar), enable HTTPS by default, perform input validation & sanitization, and enforce rate limiting.

Maintain detailed audit logs of user actions—booking changes, approvals, deletions—for accountability and traceability.

Comply with relevant data protection and privacy regulations, including user data storage and access controls.

Operational Resilience & Monitoring

Implement comprehensive error handling and graceful failure modes.

Enable application logging (structured) and health-check endpoints.

Incorporate performance monitoring tools (e.g., for latency, throughput, error rates) and error alerting systems.

Accessibility & UX

Ensure UI accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA): keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, sufficient color contrast, and clear focus indicators.

Design layouts for touch-friendly interactions on mobile.

Provide clear feedback on actions—booking successes, errors, queue updates—with helpful messaging.

Internationalization & Time Zones

Display all dates and times in the user’s local timezone, with clear venue-specific time information.

Support localization—at minimum English and Arabic—especially for UI texts, date formats, and notifications.

Scalability & Extensibility

Architect for growth—potential for multi-event support or expansion beyond the Games.

Design APIs with RESTful principles; enable future integrations (e.g., with athlete profiles, payment systems, third-party dashboards).

Build with modular design to allow extension of features like blocking special events or managing equipment bookings.

Admin Dashboard & Analytics

Provide SuperAdmins with dashboards that include calendar heatmaps, slot utilization, booking statistics per team or venue, and system alerts (e.g., conflicts, kernel queues getting long).

Include log-viewing and audit tracing tools.

Documentation & Testing

Write comprehensive documentation: API contracts, user guides per role, deployment instructions.

Develop and automate unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests—including booking flows, conflict scenarios, notification scheduling, and RESTful endpoint validation.

Suggested Development Plan

Project Setup & Core Architecture

Initialize project structure (frontend + backend), CI/CD pipelines, and development environments.

Establish basic authentication, RBAC frameworks, and request routing.

Database & Booking Logic

Model core entities: Users, Teams, Venues, Bookings, BookingRules, Notifications, AuditLogs.

Implement booking constraints, queue logic, and working hours enforcement.

Booking UI & Calendar Integration

Build calendar interface with color-coded slot statuses and mobile-responsive views.

Integrate real-time updates via WebSockets.

Notifications & Background Jobs

Implement email workflows with templating and scheduling; integrate with BullMQ or similar.

Ensure reminder emails are sent reliably.

Admin & Manager Interfaces

Design dashboards for booking oversight, rule configuration, audit log review, and statistical reporting.

Security Hardening & Compliance Checks

Finalize secure authentication/authorization.

Add rate limiting, input validation, and logging.

Testing & Quality Assurance

Deploy full test suite; conduct user acceptance tests across roles and devices.

Perform security reviews and accessibility audits.

Documentation & Handoff

Prepare all technical documentation, deployment guides, and user manuals.

Provide Replit-compatible deployment scripts or templates for easy self-hosting.
